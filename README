              EmbNN (https://github.com/skarpenko/embnn)


EmbNN is a minimalistic implementation of feedforward neural network.
It was designed with embedded applications in mind.


PREREQUISITES

  Here is the list of prerequisites required to play with EmbNN:

  * GNU C/C++ (http://gcc.gnu.org/). GNU C/C++ compiler toolchain is required
    for building EmbNN demo application. However any modern C compiler should
    work.
